(Both a fun fact and a side note: Look up “The Monument to the laboratory mouse”, a sculpture in Novosibirsk' Akademgorodok, Siberia, Russia)

“That's the thing about human life--there is no control group, no way to ever know how any of us would have turned out if any variables had been changed.”

Much can be said about this book. For one, Daniel Keyes did a brilliant job making me cry many tears. If you’re not familiar with the story, it’s about an adult man who suffers from being mentally handicapped. In the beginning of the novel, you meet Charlie in all his naivety. He lives a normal life like you and me, but in a unidimensional way. Things are black and white for him, they either make sense or they don’t. Daniel Keyes fully conveys this through Charlie’s journal entries, most of which are hard to understand because words are heavily misspelled and misused. Charlie eventually gets the opportunity to undergo a new experimental surgery that will “cure” him of his ailment. Dr. Strauss and Professor Nemur essentially mirror what they did to Algernon, their lab mouse. The experiment ends up being a success and Charlie begins his journey in newfound intellect. As you can probably guess and in more ways than one, the surgery wasn’t actually a success.

Well as Charlie grows in his mental capacity, so does his understanding of the world around him. People “become” meaner, things that didn’t have meaning before have meaning now. His intellectual growth outpaces his emotional growth and things go haywire. He falls in love with his previous adult schoolteacher (Alice Kinnian), but he’s emotionally unavailable due to unresolved childhood trauma. His relationship with the doctor and professor severs because he exceeds their abilities. His previous bakery job fires him because his coworkers don’t understand what is happening to him. All of it comes to a crashing halt when Charlie emotionally disconnects from everyone and everything. He eventually comes to the realization that things will reverse when Algernon’s health deteriorates. He decides he must come to terms with the reality of it all.

Charlie eventually meets with his parents and sister again albeit in an impersonal manner. He’s able to make love with Miss Kinnian. With Algernon’s death, he creates and publishes the “Algernon-Gordon effect” to explain the error in the experimental surgery. In the end, Charlie Gordon regresses to his “primitive” state. In the last couple of journal entries you as the reader begin to notice what’s happening as it all comes fast. In the end, we all come to terms with what happens to Charlie as he leaves to the Warren State Home…

I cried. Nope, not a little bit, but a lot.

In all honesty, I’m not much of a reader. I enjoy reading articles, reviews, and studies, but when it comes to fiction and novels I struggle. There’s a lot that goes into those neurotic tendencies, but that’s beside the point. Rather, the message I’m trying to convey here is that it took me a while to get to this book. My girlfriend read it in 2019, again in 2021, and implored me to do so as well. Well, I started reading it on July 15, 2021, and I finished on July 18, 2021. Contrast that with my two-year reading of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and you’ll realize the immense love I had for this book.

To be forthright, I don’t have a lot in common with Charlie. We’re not alike in many ways and the struggles he faced and how they came about are vastly different from my story. That much is obvious considering it’s a science fiction book. However, I do resonate with the themes and nuances that the book carries. One of which is a story of moral value. Charlie had minimal use at the bakery. One could even make the case that he was more of a liability. Fast-forward 150-pages in the book and Charlie is speaking multiple languages, discussing geopolitical problems, and critiquing papers across different fields in academia. The wild thing is that he still felt like an experiment, rather than, a human through it all. Even at an intellectually elite level, he felt like he was a lab rat and that he would be tossed aside when he died. Those emotions led him to give Algernon a proper burial towards the latter end of the book.

Although it was never put into words or writing, I think what Charlie learned through the events that transpired was the intrinsic value his life had. From the bakery to his research, his life had value even though the people around him didn’t show it.

All that is very platitudinous, but I forget it daily.

In my 24 years of life, I’ve been to four different colleges, held many belief systems, lost a lot of friends, and failed a lot. Seeing a fictional character live out failures, inadequacies, growth, success, and existential crises really caused me to take an introspective moment. Even more so I began to live vicariously through Charlie’s struggles and make them my own. Seeing him lose his sanity and deteriorate back to his primitive state hurt because I felt like all that he gained was instantly lost. Does life really give you second chances only to take them right back and leave you in a worse state? Charlie, in some ways, had a second chance but it ultimately left him to weaken and die. I think the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Life is cruel and often its cruelty stems from our own doings. Part of my tears came from me grieving for Charlie, but some of which came from me realizing that I gained a lot at his expense.

As bitter-sweet as it is to say, Charlie lost more than he started off with and even though he couldn’t realize it at the end, he learned one of the most important lessons one could possibly learn. Life has value and we as the readers get to carry that with us.
