title: Normality and Familiarity
---
(Sisyphus by Titian, 1549)

The New Year! We did it guys! We survived another one! Time moves forward, life moves on, and we follow along with it. I’m not sure about the people around me, or about the people I once knew, but life is getting kind of stagnant. No, I don’t mean achievements nor accolades, but the sentiment that comes along that stuff. We get a new job that we enjoy, we’re awarded a new certificate, we find new friends and we move forward in our relationships, but the emotions all drift away with each passing memory. So, what do we do with it all? How do we deal with the normal and the familiar?

Well, I’ve concluded that no one knows, not even God almighty. In fact, I’m starting to believe that it’s meant to be this way, its hardwired into us. This sort of illness known as the human condition. Luckily, or unfortunately, we get to decide what our cure is. There is no singular panacea and there is no medication that we can take to make it go away. Maybe it’s because the medicine is in all of us, and we must find it? Probably not. Unlike our illness, the medicine isn’t hardwired into us. It almost seems like we have to make it on our own!

The sad thing is that not everyone is able to make it. In fact, it’s quite clear that the vast majority of individuals throughout history weren’t privileged enough to make it! How depressing is that! A great number of them carried on however and it’s all starting to feel like we must do so in similar regards…

So, what’s left and what underpins this entire conversation?

What philosophy or religion do we turn to…
