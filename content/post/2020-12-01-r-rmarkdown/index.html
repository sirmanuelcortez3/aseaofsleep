<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>“I have led an extraordinary life on this planet, while at the same time travelling across the universe by using my mind and the laws of physics. I have been to the furthest reaches of our galaxy, travelled into a black hole and gone back to the beginning of time. On Earth, I have experienced highs and lows, turbulence and peace, success and suffering. I have been rich and poor, I have been able-bodied and disabled. I have been praised and criticised, but never ignored. I have been enormously privileged, through my work, in being able to contribute to our understanding of the universe. But it would be an empty universe indeed if it were not for the people I love, and who love me. Without them, the wonder of it all would be lost on me.
And at the end of all this, the fact that we humans, who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature, have been able to come to an understanding of the laws governing us, and our universe, is a great triumph. I want to share my excitement about these big questions and my enthusiasm about this quest.” ― Stephen Hawking, Brief Answers to the Big Questions</p>
<p>I resonate with that quote from the late Stephen Hawking. A brilliant mind who embodied an insatiable desire for knowledge and understanding. I am a 24 year old from the Golden State. Currently an undergraduate student, but I’m still not sure what I want to be when I grow up. I’m in a loving relationship with a beautiful girl. I hold many interests, some of which include: statistics, philosophy, mathematics, many of the sciences, most of the sciences, all of the sciences, literature, exercise, music, history, food, and all. Not sure where I’m going, or where I’ll be 5-10 years from now, but hopefully this blog will be a part of that.</p>

<h2>Why the Weblog</h2>
<p>I have a lot of thoughts and ideas I want to jot down virtually. It may or may not be of interests to people around the world, but on the perchance that it is then at least it’s out there. To be frank, I’ve lived a fairly quiet and short life. Despite that, I’ve made a lot of mistakes. Some of which left me feeling despondent, some of which still bother me, and others I’ve grown out of. It is my hope and desire that we can gather around our thoughts, regrets, and ideas through this medium.</p>
